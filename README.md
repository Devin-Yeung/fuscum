# Fuscum: An implementation of MOSS in Rust

## Why this name?

The name `fuscum` is derived from the Latin word for the species of moss,
[Sphagnum fuscum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphagnum_fuscum), also called rusty peat moss.
The name is a nod to the original MOSS system and the fact that this is a Rust implementation of it.
